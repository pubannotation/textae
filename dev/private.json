  "text": "Specific T-cell factor production and lymphocytes in the direct surroundings of a subcutaneous allogeneic tumor.\nAntigen-specific T-cell factors (TCF) play a role in the initiation of cellular immune responses. In allogeneic mouse-tumor models lymphocytes from the direct tumor surroundings of both euthymic and nude mice produce TCF. These lymphocytes produce TCF when collected already 1 day after subcutaneous (sc) injection of tumor cells. In contrast to euthymic mice, draining lymph nodes and spleen of nude mice did not contain TCF-producing lymphocytes at any stage after sc tumor cell injection. In sensitized euthymic mice TCF production by lymphocytes is significantly higher in the direct tumor surroundings than in draining lymph nodes or spleen. At 2 and 5 days after tumor cell injection, the mononuclear cell infiltrate of the tissue surrounding the tumor in euthymic mice showed low expression of Thy 1, CD3, TCR alpha beta, TCR gamma delta, CD4, CD8, and asialo GM1, whereas several lymphocytes and mast cells were positive for monoclonal antibody (mAb) 14-30 (directed against TCF). In both euthymic and nude mice, sc injected tumor cells showed apoptosis. In conclusion, the direct tumor surroundings are the first (and, for nude mice, the only) site of TCF production, sc injection of tumor cells attracts mAb 14-30-positive lymphocytes and renders mast cells positive for mAb 14-30.",
